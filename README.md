# Anomaly-Detection-In-Network-Traffic
This project implements a machine learning-based model that helps to classify network traffic as normal or anomalous using various supervised learning algorithms.

The code includes scripts for:
- Anomaly Detection
- Data preprocessing and feature selection
- Training and evaluation of machine learning models (Random Forest, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression)

Prerequisites:
To run this project, you need to have the following libraries installed:
- Python 3.x (recommended)
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
